  abstract = {Abstract Hotels are increasingly shifting their online review strategy from passive listening to proactive engagement through management responses. This study investigates the joint effects of management responses and online reviews on hotel financial performance. Based on a large unique dataset of 22,483 management responses to 76,649 online consumer reviews on TripAdvisor over 26 quarters, matched with quarterly hotel financial performance, this study finds that providing timely and lengthy responses enhances future financial performance, whereas providing responses by hotel executives and responses that simply repeat topics in the online review lowers future financial performance. Moreover, review rating and review volume moderate the effects of management responses. When the average review ratings increase, more management responses of greater length should be provided. As review volume grows, the benefits of providing timely and lengthy responses diminish. The study findings generate new implications for managing responses to online reviews to increase hotel financial performance.},
