  abstract = {Abstract Hotels are increasingly shifting their online review strategy from passive listening to proactive engagement through management responses. This study investigates the joint effects of management responses and online reviews on hotel financial performance. Based on a large unique dataset of 22,483 management responses to 76,649 online consumer reviews on TripAdvisor over 26 quarters, matched with quarterly hotel financial performance, this study finds that providing timely and lengthy responses enhances future financial performance, whereas providing responses by hotel executives and responses that simply repeat topics in the online review lowers future financial performance. Moreover, review rating and review volume moderate the effects of management responses. When the average review ratings increase, more management responses of greater length should be provided. As review volume grows, the benefits of providing timely and lengthy responses diminish. The study findings generate new implications for managing responses to online reviews to increase hotel financial performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract Consumer-generated content has provided an important new information medium for tourists, throughout the purchasing lifecycle, transforming the way that visitors evaluate, select and share experiences about tourism. Research in this area has largely focused on quantitative ratings provided on websites. However, advanced techniques for linguistic analysis provide the opportunity to extract meaning from the valuable comments provided by visitors. In this paper, we identify the key dimensions of customer service voiced by hotel visitors use a data mining approach, latent dirichlet analysis (LDA). The big data set includes 266,544 online reviews for 25,670 hotels located in 16 countries. LDA uncovers 19 controllable dimensions that are key for hotels to manage their interactions with visitors. We also find differences according to demographic segments. Perceptual mapping further identifies the most important dimensions according to the star-rating of hotels. We conclude with the implications of our study for future research and practice.},

From a collection of 412,784 user-generated reviews on TripAdvisor for 10,149 hotels from five Chinese cities, we found that foreign tourists, who speak diverse languages (English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, and Russian), differ substantially in terms of their emphasis on the roles of various hotel attributes (“Rooms,” “Location,” “Cleanliness,” “Service,” and “Value”) in forming their overall satisfaction rating for hotels. Chinese tourists domestically exhibit distinct preferences for room-related hotel attributes when compared to foreign tourists. Major interaction effects are revealed between the attributes “Rooms” and “Service” and between “Value” and “Service”.},

  abstract = {Abstract The tremendous growth of social media and consumer-generated content on the Internet has inspired the development of the so-called big data analytics to understand and solve real-life problems. However, while a handful of studies have employed new data sources to tackle important research problems in hospitality, there has not been a systematic application of big data analytic techniques in these studies. This study aims to explore and demonstrate the utility of big data analytics to better understand important hospitality issues, namely the relationship between hotel guest experience and satisfaction. Specifically, this study applies a text analytical approach to a large quantity of consumer reviews extracted from Expedia.com to deconstruct hotel guest experience and examine its association with satisfaction ratings. The findings reveal several dimensions of guest experience that carried varying weights and, more importantly, have novel, meaningful semantic compositions. The association between guest experience and satisfaction appears strong, suggesting that these two domains of consumer behavior are inherently connected. This study reveals that big data analytics can generate new insights into variables that have been extensively studied in existing hospitality literature. In addition, implications for theory and practice as well as directions for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a knowledge infrastructure which has recently been implemented as a genuine novelty at the leading Swedish mountain tourism destination, Åre. By applying a Business Intelligence approach, the Destination Management Information System Åre (DMIS-Åre) drives knowledge creation and application as a precondition for organizational learning at tourism destinations. Schianetz, Kavanagh, and Lockington’s (2007) concept of the ‘Learning Tourism Destination’ and the ‘Knowledge Destination Framework’ introduced by Höpken, Fuchs, Keil, and Lexhagen (2011) build the theoretical fundament for the technical architecture of the presented Business Intelligence application. After having introduced the development process of indicators measuring destination performance as well as customer behaviour and experience, the paper highlights how DMIS-Åre can be used by tourism managers to gain new knowledge about customer-based destination processes focused on pre- and post-travel phases, like “Web-Navigation”, “Booking” and “Feedback”. After a concluding discussion about the various components building the prototypically implemented BI-based DMIS infrastructure with data from destination stakeholders, the agenda of future research is sketched. The agenda considers, for instance, the application of real-time Business Intelligence to gain real-time knowledge on tourists’ on-site behaviour at tourism destinations.},

  abstract        = {The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that describes the characteristics and the underlying drivers of publically shared electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) for destinations. Tweets about a destination were collected while the destination hosted a hallmark event over a 5-year period (2011–2015). In each year, interactions on Twitter were analysed using macro and meso-level social network analysis to identify the network structure and hubs of eWOM activity. A K means clustering algorithm was then applied to create clusters of nodes with similar characteristics and eWOM content within each cluster was analysed using automated content analysis. The resulting model indicates that destination and event eWOM maintains a macro network structure in which a small number of accounts or hubs influence information sharing. Hub characteristics evolve over time, whereas eWOM content can fluctuate in response to emergent destination activities. © 2017 The Authors},
